 abstract = {Box plots display batches of data. Five values from a set of data are conventionally used; the extremes, the upper and lower hinges (quartiles), and the median. Such plots are becoming a widely used tool in exploratory data analysis and in preparing visual summaries for statisticians and nonstatisticians alike. Three variants of the basic display, devised by the authors, are described. The first visually incorporates a measure of group size; the second incorporates an indication of rough significance of differences between medians; the third combines the features of the first two. These techniques are displayed by examples.},

 abstract = {Mosaic displays represent the counts in a contingency table by tiles whose size is proportional to the cell count. This graphical display for categorical data generalizes readily to multi-way tables. This article discusses extensions of the mosaic display to highlight patterns of deviations from various models for categorical data. First, we introduce the use of color and shading to represent sign and magnitude of standardized residuals from a specified model. For unordered categorical variables, we show how the perception of patterns of association can be enhanced by reordering the categories. Second, we introduce sequential mosaics of marginal subtables, together with sequential models for these tables. For a class of sequential models of joint independence, the individual mosaics provide a graphic representation of a partition of the overall likelihood ratio G<sup>2</sup> for complete independence in the full table into portions attributable to hypotheses about the marginal subtables.},
